  File:     audio_qspi.h

  Purpose:  Open and play Microsoft WAV files from Quad-SPI memory chip on Feather M4 Express

            This project documents everything needed for the whole process from
            adjusting audio in Audacity, creating the WAV file, transferring your
            WAV file to the QSPI chip on a Feather M4 board, opening the file in FatSd,
            and playing the sampled audio on the DAC output.

            The SAMD51 on the Feather M4 Express has large program space, but
            it's not nearly enough to hold more than a few total seconds of
            precompiled audio. Hence, I developed this interface to play audio
            clips from the 2MB Quad-SPI memory chip.

            "Express" boards from Adafruit indicate it carries a memory chip alongside
            the processor. It is accessed via SPI interface; it is not part of the instruction set
            memory space.

  Preparing audio files:
            Prepare your WAV file to 16 kHz mono:
            1. Open Audacity
            2. Open a project, e.g. \Documents\Arduino\Griduino\work_in_progress\Spoken Word Originals\Barry
            3. Select "Project rate" of 16000 Hz
            4. Select an audio fragment, such as "Charlie"
            5. Menu bar > Effect > Normalize
               a. Remove DC offset
               b. Normalize peaks -1.0 dB
            5. Menu bar > File > Export > Export as WAV
               a. Save as type: WAV (Microsoft)
               b. Encoding: Signed 16-bit PCM
               c. Filename = e.g. "c_bwh_16.wav"
            6. The output file contains 2-byte integer numbers in the range -32767 to +32767

  Mono Audio: The DAC on the SAMD51 is a 12-bit output, from 0 - 3.3v.
            The largest 12-bit number is 4,096:
            * Writing 0 will set the DAC to minimum (0.0 v) output.
            * Writing 4096 sets the DAC to maximum (3.3 v) output.
